# Routing Explainer

Run the terminal-native route explanation:

```sh
inferctl route code --prompt-file sample-task.txt --explain
```

From this directory:

```sh
./run.sh
```

Primary route selected:

```text
selected: qwen3:8b on ollama
reason: primary model is available

candidates:
  role      backend          model                  status
  primary  ollama           qwen3:8b               selected_ready

prompt:
  15 estimated tokens / 8192 max context tokens

next: inferctl model qwen3:8b --json
```

Fallback selected:

```text
selected: qwen3:8b on ollama_small (fallback)
reason: selected fallback because primary 'qwen-coder-32b.gguf' is unavailable

candidates:
  role      backend          model                  status
  primary  llamacpp_large   qwen-coder-32b.gguf    backend_unreachable
  fallback ollama_small     qwen3:8b               selected_ready

prompt:
  15 estimated tokens / 8192 max context tokens

warnings:
- W_BACKEND_UNREACHABLE: backend 'llamacpp_large' is unreachable
- W_FALLBACK_USED: routed to fallback 'qwen3:8b' because primary 'qwen-coder-32b.gguf' is unavailable

next: inferctl backends --filter llamacpp_large --json
```

`route --explain` is the human explanation of which configured local route
inferctl would choose and why. `route --json` is the structured form for tools
and tests. Use `preflight` when automation needs pass/fail readiness behavior
before attempting work.

`route --explain` does not run inference. It answers which configured local
route inferctl would choose for a task, why that route was selected, which
candidates were considered, and which constraints shaped the decision. It does
not judge answer quality, rewrite prompts, call the selected model, start
backends, repair services, or warm models.

Use `route --json` when tools need the route decision object, candidate list,
warnings, and commands in a machine-readable form. Use `preflight` when an
automated workflow needs pass/fail readiness behavior before starting work. Use
`diff` when the question is what changed between two captured control-plane
states.
