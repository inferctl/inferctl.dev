# CI Markdown Summary

Append inferctl's existing preflight Markdown to the CI summary surface your
runner already provides:

```sh
inferctl preflight code_review \
  --prompt-file sample-pr-review-prompt.txt \
  --format markdown
```

Or use the thin wrapper from this directory:

```sh
./run-preflight-markdown.sh sample-pr-review-prompt.txt
```

This example packages product output. It does not render Markdown, define a
Markdown schema, ship a template, call a provider API, or own pull request
comment behavior. Markdown layout and redaction are preflight product behavior;
this example consumes stdout exactly as CI would.

## GitHub Actions

Use the step summary file that GitHub Actions already exposes:

```yaml
jobs:
  local-inference-preflight:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Append inferctl preflight summary
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          inferctl preflight code_review \
            --prompt-file examples/ci-markdown-summary/sample-pr-review-prompt.txt \
            --format markdown >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
```

This requires no pull request write permission because it does not post or edit
comments.

## Buildkite Or Generic Shell

Use the same command and let your CI system decide how to publish the file:

```sh
./buildkite-command.sh
```

The script writes `inferctl-preflight.md` by default. Uploading that file as an
annotation or artifact is CI-owned behavior, not inferctl-owned behavior.

## Policy Boundary

inferctl emits local inference state. Your CI system decides where to publish
that Markdown and whether a job should continue.

preflight does not run the model, post pull request comments, call GitHub,
Buildkite, GitLab, or hosted services, or manage CI annotations. The same
Markdown can be redirected to any summary, annotation, artifact, or comment
tooling that your workflow owns.

Fallback policy is controlled by preflight flags and ordinary shell behavior:

```sh
# Warning-only fallback: Markdown is still emitted and the job may continue.
inferctl preflight code_review \
  --prompt-file sample-pr-review-prompt.txt \
  --allow-fallback \
  --format markdown >> "$SUMMARY_FILE"

# Blocking fallback: omit --allow-fallback and let set -e fail the step.
inferctl preflight code_review \
  --prompt-file sample-pr-review-prompt.txt \
  --format markdown >> "$SUMMARY_FILE"
```

For a stricter gate that decides whether an automation step should run, use the
Preflight Gate example in `examples/preflight-gate/`. This example is only the
CI summary packaging for the same preflight decision.

Generated samples and regression checks must come from real
`inferctl preflight --format markdown` output or checked fixture output. If the
preflight formatter changes, update this example from command output rather than
editing an independent Markdown contract.
