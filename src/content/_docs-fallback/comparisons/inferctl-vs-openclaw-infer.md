# inferctl compared with OpenClaw Infer

**Research date:** 2026-09-07  
**inferctl baseline:** v0.3.0, commit [`c50c21c`](https://github.com/inferctl/inferctl/tree/c50c21cfff8f22e4734431534e10234d135e3b3d)  
**OpenClaw documentation baseline:** stable release v2026.9.2, commit [`3928bad`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/3928bad9badfcb6c7d140530435e806fb8092190)  
**OpenClaw source inspection:** local `main` checkout, commit [`c47fa27`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/c47fa27ac39c1b2e2486c05a038220ac01e50025), 2026-09-07; current [Inference CLI reference](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/infer)

## Decision

Use **inferctl** to inspect local inference backends, select a configured route,
and decide if an automated task can start. It does not send an inference
request.

Use **`openclaw infer`** to send a provider request and get a result. It can
run a text model and can also generate or process image, audio, video, web, and
embedding data.

They have different jobs. Neither is a replacement for the other.

## Main differences

| Area | inferctl | `openclaw infer` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main job | Local inference control plane | Provider-backed inference command surface |
| Sends prompts to a model | No | Yes, for execution commands |
| Inference traffic | Never passes through inferctl | The command sends provider requests through its selected local or Gateway path |
| Main output | Backend health, model inventory, route decisions, readiness, snapshots, and status | Text, generated media, transcriptions, search/fetch results, embeddings, and provider details |
| Backend scope | Configured Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio, MLX, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints | Providers and models already configured in OpenClaw |
| Routing | Selects a configured backend/model for a named task and explains the decision | Uses the selected provider/model; `--provider` or `--model provider/model` can pin it |
| State checks | `doctor`, `preflight`, `status`, `snapshot`, and `diff` | Structured configuration and execution preparation; a cron-only endpoint preflight; provider results and model probes |
| Automation contract | JSON envelopes, stable error codes, and explicit control-plane commands | A shared JSON envelope with capability, transport, provider, model, attempts, outputs, and error fields |
| Configuration | inferctl TOML configuration and environment overrides | OpenClaw provider, model, agent, and authentication configuration |
| Local runtime management | Does not run, load, warm, proxy, retry, or release models | Does not replace a model runtime; it calls configured providers and local model services |

The inferctl boundary is intentional. `preflight`, `status`, and related
commands can inspect prompt metadata for context checks, but they do not send
prompt text, run completions, warm a model, or load a model. See the
[inferctl Agent Guide](https://github.com/inferctl/inferctl/blob/c50c21cfff8f22e4734431534e10234d135e3b3d/docs/agent-guide.md).

OpenClaw's local `model run` is also deliberately narrow: it resolves the
configured model and authentication, then performs a one-shot provider
completion. It does not start a full chat-agent turn with tools, memory, or a
session transcript. Use an OpenClaw agent or chat surface when that full agent
context is required. See the [OpenClaw inference command behavior](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/infer#behavior).

Source inspection shows that this is not a few ad hoc checks in the command
handler. OpenClaw has reusable model preparation code for model selection,
authentication, OpenAI route selection, runtime plugins, and transport binding.
That code prepares an immediate request; it does not publish a general,
no-request local-backend readiness result.

## Command mapping

There is no one-to-one command mapping because the tools operate at different
layers.

| Need | inferctl | `openclaw infer` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check configured local backends | `inferctl backends --json` | No equivalent local-backend inventory command |
| Check installed or loaded local models | `inferctl models --json` | No equivalent. `openclaw infer model providers --json` reports catalog/configuration facts, not live local runtime state |
| Select a task route without execution | `inferctl route code --json` | No equivalent planning-only route command |
| Check that a task is ready | `inferctl preflight code --json` | No general equivalent. OpenClaw has a cron-specific endpoint preflight with narrower checks |
| Run a text prompt | Not supported by design | `openclaw infer model run --prompt "..." --json` |
| Generate or edit an image | Not supported | `openclaw infer image generate` or `image edit` |
| Transcribe audio | Not supported | `openclaw infer audio transcribe --file <file>` |
| Create speech | Not supported | `openclaw infer tts convert --text "..." --output <file>` |
| Generate or describe video | Not supported | `openclaw infer video generate` or `video describe` |
| Search or fetch the web | Not supported | `openclaw infer web search` or `web fetch` |
| Create embeddings | Not supported | `openclaw infer embedding create --text "..."` |
| Record and compare local control-plane state | `inferctl snapshot`, `diff`, and `status --watch --events` | No equivalent snapshot/diff command in the Infer CLI reference |

## What OpenClaw prepares before a model request

For local `openclaw infer model run`, OpenClaw runs this sequence before it
sends the completion request:

1. Validate the prompt, thinking level, transport choice, `provider/model`
   override form, selected agent, and image inputs.
2. Resolve command configuration and secret references. It can auto-enable
   required plugins, then pins the effective configuration snapshot.
3. Resolve the selected agent, model reference, aliases, static model catalog,
   plugin metadata, provider runtime, and transport.
4. Resolve authentication, including provider profiles and configured OpenAI
   route selection. Missing authentication fails before execution.
5. Send the one-message completion request.

This is a substantial execution-admission path. It is not a substitute for a
local runtime control plane:

- The normal local command uses a static model catalog and skips agent
  discovery. It does not first probe the selected provider endpoint.
- It does not establish that a local model is installed, loaded, has enough
  capacity, accepts the input, or will return text.
- Provider connection failures, model incompatibility, and an empty response
  are found during the completion request.

`openclaw infer model providers` also does not report live reachability. Its
current implementation derives `configured` from stored configuration,
authentication profiles, plugin configuration, or environment variables; it
initializes catalog providers as available. Treat it as provider inventory, not
as a health report.

OpenClaw has a separate endpoint preflight for isolated cron jobs. It probes
configured local Ollama or OpenAI-completions endpoints with a short `GET`
request, caches the result, and may choose a reachable fallback. It is not used
by normal `infer model run`. An HTTP response means that the endpoint is alive;
authentication and model failures remain for the normal model runner. This is
useful execution support, but it is not a general model-readiness interface.

## When to use inferctl

Choose inferctl when an agent, CI job, or operator needs answers to questions
such as these:

- Which configured local backend is reachable?
- Is the selected model installed or loaded?
- Which backend and model does the `code` task select, and why?
- Can a job start now, with or without a fallback route?
- Did the selected route, reachable backend set, or warnings change since the
  last recorded state?

It is useful before a job calls a provider directly. The caller receives the
route from `inferctl route --json`, then calls the selected backend itself.

## When to use OpenClaw Infer

Choose `openclaw infer` when the required outcome is an actual provider result:

- A one-shot text or vision-model response.
- Image generation, editing, or description.
- Audio transcription or text-to-speech conversion.
- Video generation or description.
- Web search, page fetch, or embedding creation.

Use `--json` in automation. OpenClaw documents stable top-level fields such as
`ok`, `capability`, `transport`, `provider`, `model`, `attempts`, `outputs`,
and `error`. For media commands, use the structured `outputs` data instead of
parsing text output. See [JSON output](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/infer#json-output).

## How they can work together

They can be used in the same workflow when the local provider is configured in
both products. Keep the boundary explicit:

1. Run `inferctl preflight <task> --json` or `inferctl route <task> --json`.
2. Stop or select a fallback if the control-plane result is not acceptable.
3. Map the approved route to the matching OpenClaw provider/model setting.
4. Run `openclaw infer ... --json` to do the provider work.

This needs an explicit route-to-provider mapping. The reviewed documentation
does not describe an automatic integration where OpenClaw consumes inferctl
route decisions.

## Limits and operational notes

- inferctl is not a proxy, provider client, benchmark tool, or model lifecycle
  manager. A successful `preflight` does not prove model quality or successful
  generation.
- OpenClaw Infer needs valid provider configuration and authentication for the
  chosen provider. An OpenClaw provider command can fail after a control-plane
  check succeeds.
- OpenClaw's normal `infer model run` is its narrow live provider smoke test.
  It sends the prompt. `openclaw models status --probe` also sends a synthetic
  model request, so neither is a no-prompt readiness command.
- OpenClaw requires the full `provider/model` form for explicit models on some
  commands, including audio transcription and image/video description.
- The normal local OpenClaw path does not require a Gateway. Gateway state
  commands, such as `tts status`, do require it.
- inferctl publishes no packaged binaries at this baseline. Installation is by
  `go install` or a local source build. See [Installing inferctl](https://github.com/inferctl/inferctl/blob/c50c21cfff8f22e4734431534e10234d135e3b3d/docs/install.md).
