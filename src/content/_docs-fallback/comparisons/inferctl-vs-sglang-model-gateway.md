# inferctl and SGLang Model Gateway

**Research date:** 2026-09-08
**inferctl source baseline:** `main`, commit [`55f779c`](https://github.com/inferctl/inferctl/tree/55f779c8a6405c7eef6fa41fb865b405f4cc3439)
**SGLang source baseline:** v0.5.19, commit [`0bcd822`](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/0bcd822377da7b5718e674eaf9c870d349424dd1), released 2026-09-05

## Conclusion

Use [**SGLang Model Gateway**](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) when a
deployment needs an in-band model gateway that manages workers, balances live
traffic, supports multiple protocols and models, performs health checks, and
applies request-time reliability controls.

Use **inferctl** when an operator or agent needs a local, read-only decision
before request submission. inferctl does not start SGLang workers, host or
proxy gateway routes, hold conversation history, run retries, or change
gateway policy.

## Scope and architecture

SGLang Model Gateway is a model-routing gateway for large deployments. It can
manage worker lifecycle, route HTTP, gRPC, and OpenAI-compatible traffic, and
use regular or prefill/decode router stacks. Its inference-gateway mode can
route multiple models through one router. See the pinned [gateway overview](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/0bcd822377da7b5718e674eaf9c870d349424dd1/docs/docs/advanced_features/sgl_model_gateway.mdx#L2-L94) and [multi-model gateway mode](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/0bcd822377da7b5718e674eaf9c870d349424dd1/docs/docs/advanced_features/sgl_model_gateway.mdx#L259-L274).

The gateway has request-time retries with jitter, worker circuit breakers,
rate limiting, queuing, background health checks, cache-aware load monitoring,
and Prometheus and OpenTelemetry observability. It therefore has a different
boundary from inferctl. See the pinned [reliability and observability summary](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/0bcd822377da7b5718e674eaf9c870d349424dd1/docs/docs/advanced_features/sgl_model_gateway.mdx#L69-L90).

## Capability comparison

| Area | SGLang Model Gateway v0.5.19 | inferctl at `55f779c` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary job | In-band model routing, worker operation, and gateway policy. | Out-of-band local backend inspection, route planning, and readiness. |
| Inference traffic | Receives, routes, and proxies live inference traffic. | Does not receive, proxy, or execute inference requests. |
| Worker lifecycle | Can co-launch router and workers or route to independent worker endpoints. | Does not start, stop, load, unload, or alter a backend. |
| Request policy | Load and cache-aware policy, retry, circuit breakers, rate limiting, and queueing. | Selects a named task route before a request. |
| Model routing | Multi-model ingress and regular or prefill/decode routing stacks. | Local named-task route selection. |
| Health and state | Worker health, readiness, admin APIs, worker list, and engine metrics. | Bounded no-prompt preflight plus snapshots and diffs. |
| Observability | Prometheus metrics, tracing, structured logs, and request IDs. | Control-plane status frames and JSON reports. |

## What SGLang Model Gateway does well

- It routes live traffic to healthy workers and can manage router-worker
  deployment modes.
- It supports OpenAI-compatible, native HTTP, and gRPC request paths.
- It supports multi-model and prefill/decode routing configurations.
- It applies request-time reliability and rate controls.
- It offers admin worker metadata, health, readiness, engine metrics, and
  Prometheus telemetry.

The pinned [admin and health API section](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/0bcd822377da7b5718e674eaf9c870d349424dd1/docs/docs/advanced_features/sgl_model_gateway.mdx#L704-L802) distinguishes liveness, worker availability, worker health, and
generate health checks. The last of these can generate output, so it is not a
no-prompt health claim.

## What inferctl does differently

inferctl can inspect configured local backend evidence, explain a named-task
route, and return a redacted handoff without carrying the prompt. It remains
outside the worker, request, history, and policy paths. It does not replace
SGLang's server and gateway operation.

## Composition

Configure an SGLang Model Gateway endpoint as an inferctl OpenAI-compatible
backend when its API has suitable compatibility. Run inferctl first, assess
the local result, then send the request to SGLang. Keep workers, gateway
policies, history storage, retries, rate limits, and metrics configuration in
SGLang. The reviewed sources show no automatic SGLang consumption of an
inferctl handoff.

## Limits and claims not to make

- Do not call inferctl an SGLang gateway, worker manager, or retry service.
- Do not call SGLang Model Gateway a read-only external control plane.
- Do not call `/health_generate` a no-prompt readiness check.
- Do not treat worker lists or gateway metrics as inferctl snapshots or proof
  that every future generation will succeed.
