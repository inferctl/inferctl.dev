# Inference control-plane landscape

**Research date:** 2026-09-08
**inferctl source baseline:** `main`, commit [`86ef4c2`](https://github.com/inferctl/inferctl/tree/86ef4c2f8eb8204bb00fe207a989bb3639952c93)
**External-source review date:** 2026-09-07, unless a row gives another date

## Conclusion

Inference runtimes execute models. Request gateways receive and control live
inference requests. inferctl is different: it is an out-of-band local
inference control plane. It inspects configured backends, gathers evidence,
plans named task routes, and tests readiness without sending an inference
prompt. It does not proxy inference traffic, execute prompts, retry requests,
load models, or change backend state.

This is a living index. It records the comparison research that is complete
and the research that is still in progress. It does not make a performance,
replacement, or universal-backend claim.

## The three tool classes

| Class | Main job | Inference request path | Example role with inferctl |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Inference runtime** | Loads and executes one or more models. | Owns model execution. | inferctl can inspect the configured runtime before a client sends a request. |
| **Request gateway** | Receives, proxies, routes, retries, or observes live requests. | Is in the request path. | A caller can use inferctl for local route evidence before it calls the gateway. |
| **Out-of-band control plane** | Inspects state and prepares a route without carrying traffic. | Is outside the request path. | inferctl selects a configured route and returns readiness evidence. |

The categories can overlap in one product. For example, a server can provide
health APIs and still be a runtime or gateway when it receives inference
requests. The deciding question here is whether the tool carries the live
request.

## Product position

inferctl is a local control-plane CLI. It can inspect configured inference
backends, report backend and model evidence where a backend exposes it, select
a named route, and run a bounded readiness check without a model prompt. Its
machine-readable commands support scripts and agents.

inferctl does not send inference or model-lifecycle requests. The client that
uses its result owns authentication, streaming, retries, timeouts, request
execution, and lifecycle actions. A successful readiness result is evidence
for a selected route. It is not proof of model quality or a successful model
response. See the pinned [preparation contract](https://github.com/inferctl/inferctl/blob/86ef4c2f8eb8204bb00fe207a989bb3639952c93/docs/preparation-contract.md) and [agent guide](https://github.com/inferctl/inferctl/blob/86ef4c2f8eb8204bb00fe207a989bb3639952c93/docs/agent-guide.md).

## Composition

inferctl can compose with both runtimes and gateways. A typical workflow is:

1. Configure the runtime or gateway as an inferctl backend.
2. Run `inferctl route <task> --json` or `inferctl preflight <task> --json`.
3. Let the caller stop, choose a permitted fallback, or use the returned
   handoff.
4. Send the inference request directly to the selected runtime or gateway.

The runtime or gateway remains responsible for request execution and any
request-time routing, retries, model lifecycle, policy, or observability.
inferctl remains outside that request path.
